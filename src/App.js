Feeding frenzy - To eat a large amount of food, probably in a frantic
manner. Also refers to consuming anything in a frantic way, such as the

It seemed like all the magazines were in a feeding frenzy for stories about
my favorite celebrity. There were stories printed all over the place.
Feel like a million dollars - To feel extremely goodâ€”both in the way you
feel inside and the way you look.
I felt like a million dollars when I was dressed up for the banquet last night.
Feel the pinch - To feel the effects of a lack of money or other resources.
The business had been feeling the pinch. Money was in short supply and
they weren't sure how they could continue to offer their services.

        Well begun is half done - It's important to get a good start. Megan was
        worried that she wouldn't do a good job on the project, but I thought
        she'd made a really good start. I reassured her and reminded her that
        well begun is half done. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it - We
        will deal with that problem when we have to. Don't worry about that
        problem right now. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
        Well-heeled - Wealthy and well-dressed. Chloe started working at an
        upscale boutique this week. She told me a bit about all of her
        well-heeled customers. Went the extra mile - To do even more than is
        required. The group went the extra mile with their class project. They
        did more than was required and ended up with an A+. Wet behind the ears
        - Inexperienced and probably young. The new guy in the office is really
        young and wet behind the ears. He hardly has any experience in this
        field. Wet blanket - An individual who others feel ruins a fun or
        enjoyable experience. Dan is such a wet blanket. He always tries to ruin
        the fun when we're having a party
